# Overview of the Connecticut BNL Weekly Status Report
This weekly status report is based on data that is recorded on the By Name List (BNL) in HMIS. In order for improvements and progress toward CAN and statewide goals to be recorded and appear in the report, client statuses must be updated on the HMIS BNL.
 
## The Data in the Report
The report is divided into three main sections: (1) BNL Activity, (2) Unverified CH Statuses, and (3) Verified CH Statuses.  Data in all sections is calculated by CAN and statewide.

**(1) BNL Activity** *[blue section – rows a,b,c,d,e]*

A snapshot summary of the number of active records on the BNL as of the report date (shown at the top of the report).  # Active on BNL (row a) is a count of clients who are marked as Active on the HMIS BNL. # Added in past 7 days (row b) is the raw count of clients who were added to the BNL as active in the 7 days preceding the report date, based on the active date entered on the BNL.  Avg, Median, and Max (rows c,d,e) days Active on BNL are based on the number of days that all active clients have been active.
 
**(2) Unverified CH Statuses** *[orange section – rows f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m]*

This section is a summary of all active records on the BNL that have an unverified CH status (row f), which includes the number of clients whose CH status is unknown/blank (row g) and the number of clients whose CH status is potentially chronic (row h). A subset of clients who are potentially chronic and matched to housing resources is also included (row i).  Data is also included to count the number of clients who are marked as “might be chronic in the next 3 months” (row j). Avg, Median, and Max (rows k,l,m) days in an unverified CH status are based on the number of days that all active unverified clients clients have been active.

**(3) Verified CH Statuses** *[green section – rows n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w]*

This section is a summary of all active records on the BNL that have a verified CH status (row n), which includes the number of clients whose CH status is Chronic (Verified) (row o) and the number of clients whose CH status is Not Chronic (Verified) (row u). Subsets of clients in both statuses included for those who are matched (rows p and v). Data is also included for the number of clients who have been Chronic (Verified) for 91+ days (q). For clients who are Not Chronic (Verified), data is also included to count the number of clients who are marked as “might be chronic in the next 3 months” (row w). For clients who are Chronic (Verified), the Avg, Median, and Max (rows r,s,t) days Chronic (Verified) are based on the number of days since the verification date listed for these clients on the BNL.
 
## The Goals in the Report
The report tracks progress statewide and by CAN toward goals in the following areas:

1.	Unknown/Blank CH Status - Fewer than 10% (or 20 individuals, whichever is greater) of the active BNL will have an Unknown/Blank CH status
2.	Potentially Chronic CH Status -Fewer than 10% (or 20 individuals, whichever is greater) of the active BNL will have a Potentially Chronic CH status
3.	Active Clients will have a verified CH Status within an average of 30 days from their BNL Active date – When clients are added to the BNL or made Active on the BNL, their CH status will be determined within 30 days on average. 
4.	Chronic (Verified) Clients will be Housed within an average of 90 days from their verification date – Our goal for functional zero is to have clients housed within 90 days of the date on which they are verified to meet the HUD criteria for chronicity
 
## Recording Progress Toward Goals and Improving Data Quality
All data in this report is tabulated from the HMIS BNL export and represents a snapshot in time as of the report date shown at the top of the report. The following are some ways that the BNL can be proactively managed to show progress toward these goals and improve data quality.
 
Goals 1, 2, and 3 - Verify the CH status of people on the Active BNL who are marked as "Potentially Chronic" or who have an Unknown/Blank CH Status
    * Mark clients as “Not Chronic (Verified)” if they do not currently meet the HUD criteria for chronic homelessness    
* Mark clients as “Chronic (Verified)” when they do meet the HUD criteria for chronic homelessness
* Mark clients as Inactive if they are not currently active
 
Goal 4 – House Chronic (Verified) clients within an average of 90 days
    * Accurately record the date on which the client’s chronic status was verified
    * Mark Chronic (Verified) clients as Inactive and Housed as soon as they are housed

## Clean up outliers on the BNL
* Sort the BNL export by Active date to identify clients who have been active for the longest amount of time and update their active dates (if they have recently become active after a period of activity), or mark them as inactive (if they are in fact not active).
* Sort the BNL export by CH Verification Date to identify clients who have been Chronic (Verified) for the longest amount of time and identify barriers to housing them (or mark them as inactive and housed if they have been housed).
